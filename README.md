## Description-Of-Code

* The main focus of this project was to build a timed quiz that allows the user to save their final score. The main home page consists of two buttons and a title. One button that designates the start of the quiz and another that directs the user to the high scores page. Once the user clicks "Begin" they are allowed 60 seconds to answer all the questions the quiz consists of. The user can keep track of their score with each correct answer which is displayed above the displayed questions. There are 4 questions worth 25 points a piece with a total score of 100. Once the final question is answered the user is then prompted with the ability to either retake the test, save the current score, or go to the home page.
